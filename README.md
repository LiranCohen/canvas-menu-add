canvas-menu-add
===============

WooThemes' Canvas Mobile Menu Addition.  Hides sub-menus in mobile mode and shows them only when clicked.

This will add the display:none property to all sub-menus so that only the top-level menus are shown in mobile mode.  

When the top-level menu is clicked it will show the sub-menus below it.  If you click on the top-level menu a 2nd time it will route to the top-level menu URL destination.

This plugin works recursively, so this will allow sub-menus which have sub-menus within them to behave the same way.

**There is also sometimes a CSS glitch if you leave the menu open in mobile mode and then resize the window to a another mode, this plugin fixes that issue by closing the menu whenever the width is resized.
